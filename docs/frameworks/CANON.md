# Logic Codex Canon Architecture

This document defines the foundational system rules and structural standards for all Logic Codex artifacts.

---

## Core Principles

- Identity Preservation
- Prompt Reproducibility
- Modular Architecture
- Cross-Tool Compatibility
- Human-Readable Systems

---

## Canon Rules

1. All reusable systems must be documented.
2. Prompts must be reproducible without hidden steps.
3. Identity-lock frameworks must be explicit.
4. Versioning is mandatory for public releases.

---

## Status

This Canon file will evolve alongside Logic && Lore Studio infrastructure development.
